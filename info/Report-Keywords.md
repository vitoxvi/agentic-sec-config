# Report Keywords

This document acts as a live documentation in which we can add keywords on the fly of how AI as been used so far etc.
This should help us writing the report more easily later.


## Vito
- Wrote down project idea in keywords, added grading criteria and let chatgpt extend it to a full project
- Passed on to julian who added some ideas and again finalized using AI

- Asked ChatGPT to generate us a raodmap.md based on the project description, grading criteria and overview of SDKs to use
- Had GPT give me detailed instructions on how to setup uv environment
- GPT generated scaffold of the repo, downloadable as zip
- GPT unable to come up with seansible health checks in files -> switched to cursor IDE to use AI in codebase directly
