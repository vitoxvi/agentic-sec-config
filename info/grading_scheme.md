## Project architectural requirements (A)


### A1 - Modular Structure
Agentic AI architecture
– LLM-driven agents that interact with each other
– Use tools to complete tasks
– Best for multi-step tasks
– MCP is an open protocol that lets LLM apps securely connect to tools, data, and services via standardized MCP servers.
– MCP server exposes tools/files/prompts; client (IDE/app/agent) calls them.


### A2 - Security Protection
Security of Agentic AI application
– Adopt a security mechanism
– MCP servers can access tools and resources
– Adopt a mechanism for access control
– Specify access permissions in advance


## Checklist for a good project (B): touch these 4 points

### B1 - Modular Structure
Project structure and roadmap: modular and incremental
E.g., local app that does X but also
– AniceGUIfortheapp
– A GUI extension with a more advance library
– Can connect with similar apps over the internet
– Has an optional algorithm that speeds up certain computations – Connect to an external module to send SMSs
– Optional database for large data storage


### B2 - AI Beyond Coding
In which tasks can AI support you beyond coding?
– Breaking down the project into tasks
– Defining the interfaces/APIs
– Software design
– Debugging
– Testing
– Performance optimization
– Learning new languages/libraries, etc


### B3 Push AI to the limit
Overall aim for a project that you would not be able to compete without AI
– Libraries that you don’t know
– (part of the project in) languages that you don’t know
– Tasks/optimizations/functionalities that you would find very challenging

### B4 Meta Level
Optional: include some AI for coding (optional) functionality in the project
– A code editor that helps you developing code
– Alearningplatformforcoding
– Automated generation of configuration scripts
– Self-improving code in the project
